The 2,099 new cases consist of 1,258 "fresh" or newly validated cases and 841 cases reported late, and brings the total to 46,333.

Total recoveries also rose to 12,185 after 243 more patients recovered from the respiratory disease, while the death toll climbed to 1,303 with six new fatalities.

The Philippines now has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases across Southeast Asia, overtaking Singapore with 44,983 infections and trailing behind Indonesia with 64,958.

"Dapat po ba natin itong ikabahala? Ang sagot po namin, oo, dahil nakikita po natin na tumataas muli ang bilang ng mga kaso," Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a briefing.

"Ngunit ibig sabihin po ba nito wala na tayong magagawa? Hindi po. May magagawa po tayo. Meron na po tayong established protocols na dapat nating sundin upang makaiwas tayo sa virus," she added.

The number of fresh cases also reached a new record high, 601 of which are from Metro Manila, 280 are from Region VII, 48 are repatriates, while the remaining 329 are spread out across the country.

The DOH noted that the fresh cases reported on Monday were only based on data submitted by 56 out of 73 operational laboratories.

Among the late cases, 397 are from Metro Manila, 186 are from Region VII, 46 are repatriates, while the 212 other patients came from various areas nationwide.

There are also 32,845 active cases undergoing treatment or quarantine.

The DOH also said it removed 20 duplicate cases from the total tally of infections.

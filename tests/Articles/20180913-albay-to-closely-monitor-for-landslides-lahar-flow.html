ALBAY TO CLOSELY MONITOR FOR LANDSLIDES, LAHAR FLOW

Although Albay is not directly along the path of Typhoon Ompong, emergency response officials of the province are in the thick of preparations for the effects of the storm as this could be enhanced by the habagat.

According to Oscar Oida's report on State of the Nation with Jessica Soho, Albay Public Safety and Emergency Management Office (APSEMO) is set to monitor the hourly rainfall for the possibility of flash floods, landslides and lahar flow particularly in areas near Mount Mayon.

"So ang preparation nila flood, landslide, and possible lahar kung malapit sa Mayon. Kung hindi, malapit sa ilog flashflood and river flow," APSEMO chief Cedric Daep explained.

With this, they would be closely monitoring the amount of rainfall that Ompong will bring to the province.

for landslides, the APSEMO will be checking cumulative rainfall while for lahar and flood they will be monitoring the hourly amount of rainfall.

According to APSEMO, residents in landslide-prone areas should be instructed to evacuate before the amount of rainfall reaches 220mm per hour.

In the Mayon area, as lahar flows are triggered by a smaller threshold of 60mm of rain per hour, residents should be evacuated as soon as it reaches 40 mm.

"Mayroon kaming amount ng rainfall na kailangan lumikas na sila for a lead time of three to four hours," Daep said.

"Pag two hours, baka kapusin," he added. - MARGARET CLAIR LAYUG/BAP, GMA NEWS

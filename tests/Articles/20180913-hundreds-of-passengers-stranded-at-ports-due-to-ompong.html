HUNDREDS OF PASSENGERS STRANDED AT PORTS DUE TO OMPONG

Sea trips cancelled due to Typhoon Ompong on Thursday left hundreds of passengers stranded various ports in northern Samar and the Bicol region.

Oscar Oida reported on State of the Nation with Jessica Soho that almost 700 people were stranded at the port of Allen, Northern Samar.

They were supposed to travel to Sorsogon and Ticao Island in Masbate, which are among the areas placed under Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal (TCWS) No. 1.

Owners of small sea crafts are advised not to venture out over the seaboards of areas under a typhoon warning signal.

"'Pag Signal No. 1 at 2, usually hindi kami nagpapa-evacuate ng mga vehicles," Rod Suan, Allen's former mayor, explained.

"'Pag 3 and 4, lahat talaga ng mga sasakyan sa ports, kino-contain na natin sa holding area namin," he added.

As many as 33 areas were placed under Signal No. 1 while Isabela was placed under Signal No. 2 on Thursday evening as Typhoon Ompong continued to barrel toward northern Luzon.

PAGASA's latest advisory (http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/weather/667701/signal-no-2-over-isabela-as-ompong-barrels-toward-northern-luzon/story/) said the typhoon could make landfall in the Cagayan-Isabela area on Saturday morning. - MARGARET CLAIRE LAYUG/BAP, GMA NEWS

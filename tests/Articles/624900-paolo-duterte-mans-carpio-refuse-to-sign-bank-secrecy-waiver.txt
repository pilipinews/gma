PAOLO DUTERTE, MANS CARPIO REFUSE TO SIGN BANK SECRECY WAIVER

Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte and his brother-in-law, lawyer Manases "Mans" Carpio, refused to sign a document that would waive their bank secrecy rights, after Senator Antonio Trillanes IV claimed they have more than P100 million each in their accounts.

During the Senate blue ribbon committee hearing on the smuggled P6.4-billion shabu shipment Thursday, Trillanes asked both Paolo and Carpio whether they were willing to sign a waiver.

"Are you willing to sign it? Anyway, kung mali ako dito, the whole world will laugh at me. Are you willing to sign it?" Trillanes asked.

Carpio refused to sign it, saying he is "not familiar with the figures."

"I have the same answer. I will not sign the waiver," Paolo said.

According to Trillanes, the Davao vice mayor has P104 million in total deposits in his bank accounts, while Carpio has P121 million, both as of November 2015.

Smiling, Carpio said he "invokes the bank secrecy [law]." Trillanes slammed Carpio saying: "Bakit ka natatawa, Atty. Carpio? I'm asking you...Magtatago ka rin lang pala, tatawa ka pa."

"I'm disputing it because I don't have much money that's why I'm smiling earlier," Carpio said.

Senator Richard Gordon, chairman of the blue ribbon committee, meanwhile, warned Trillanes to refrain from "editorializing."

"It's unfair to the witness. The witness has already answered," Gordon told Trillanes. - RSJ, GMA NEWS

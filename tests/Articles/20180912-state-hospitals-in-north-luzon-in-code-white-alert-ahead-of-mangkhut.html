Duque reportedly ordered the concerned hospitals to ensure that they have working generator sets and for doctors and other medical staff to be on standby for possible emergencies.

The DOH is set to provide hospitals in the two regions with additional medicines to beef up their prepositioned stocks.

Duque has also ordered the creation of Health Rapid Emergency Management Teams to assist local government units and social workers in addressing the needs of affected communities.

The teams were instructed to be "proactive" in areas considered as "high risk."

Mangkhut, which is described as a super typhoon, is expected to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility within the day. Once inside PAR, it will be named Ompong.

PAGASA said Mangkhut is expected to reach the Batanes-Cagayan area by Saturday.

However, the weather service warned that the typhoon's effects would also be felt over Central Luzon and over the eastern section southern Luzon. -KBK, GMA NEWS

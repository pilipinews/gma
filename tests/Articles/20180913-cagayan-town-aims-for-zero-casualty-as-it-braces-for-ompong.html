CAGAYAN TOWN AIMS FOR ZERO CASUALTY AS IT BRACES FOR OMPONG

Anticipating Typhoon Ompong, disaster officials in Gonzaga, Cagayan, are aiming to replicate their success during super typhoon Lawin in 2016 when no casualties were recorded in the municipality.

"Sana ganun rin po, makakaya po namin," Edward Gaspar, head of Gonzaga's Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (MDRRMC), told Dobol B sa News TV.

Gaspar said preparations started as early as September 10 amid warnings that Ompong, which weather forecasters said has the potential to become a super typhoon, will make landfall in the province.

He said up to 147 families will be evacuated by 2 p.m. on Thursday from barangays that may be affected by storm surges associated with the typhoon.

In total, 183 families will be affected by storm surges in Gonzaga and 757 families will be affected by floodings.

Families will be evacuated to two big evacuation centers with the capacity of 600 families each, and to schools around the municipality, the official said.

Isabela provincial disaster officer Edmond de Guzman said in another interview that Governor Faustino Dy III has ordered forced evacuations in the coastal municipalities of Maconacon, Divilacan, and Dinapigue.

"Ipapairal muna yung preevacuation ngayon, the fact na 'di pa gaano nararamdaman. Pero kapag lumakas na, ito yung tinatawag na forced evacuation sa area na 'to," De Guzman said.

The provincial government has also banned fisherfolk from setting sail since Wednesday due to inclement weather. It also banned the sale of liquor for safety reasons.

Some barangays in Northern Isabela received relief goods ahead of the typhoon while more relief goods are being prepared, especially for families of fisherfolk.

Preemptive evacuation measures were undertaken by the Cagayan government to protect some 10,000 residents in coastal areas as Ompong entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on Wednesday.

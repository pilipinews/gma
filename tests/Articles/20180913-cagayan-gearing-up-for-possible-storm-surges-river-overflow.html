CAGAYAN GEARING UP FOR POSSIBLE STORM SURGES, RIVER OVERFLOW

Residents along the coastal areas of Cagayan have been advised to seek safer ground and to brace themselves for Typhoon Ompong, which is expected to make landfall over the province on Saturday.

According to a report by GMA News' Chino Gaston for 24 Oras on Thursday, the government is preparing for possible storm surges and overflowing of the Cagayan River.

The government of Sta. Ana ordered the forced evacuation of some 2,500 residents in coastal barangays.

"Kung kailangan hilain sila ng ten-wheeler, hihilain natin sila. 'Yan ang order ko dahil hindi sila 'yung magsu-suffer ng husto, lahat magsu-suffer," Sta. Ana Mayor Darwin Tobias said.

Most of the people, however, opted to stay and fortify their homes against the effects of the storm. The fishing boats have been secured on land.

The residents in the coastal area of Bugey are securing their roofs to their homes while boats were secured.

In Camalaniugan town, which is beside the Cagayan River, officials went around town to remind the people to prepare for the effects of the coming storm.

Rescue teams, relief goods and emergency equipment have been pre-positioned at the province's command center.

"Pinagbabantay lahat na low-lying areas ng northern Luzon, ng downstream po tawag namin lahat ng coastal areas kasi po magkakaroon tayo ng preemptive evacuation," JC Mendoza of Task Force Lingkod Cagayan said.

According to data from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, most or 90 percent of areas in Cagayan are susceptible to flooding while more than half of its barangays are vulnerable to landslides.
